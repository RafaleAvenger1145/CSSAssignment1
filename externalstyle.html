        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Understanding how GPUs and CPUs can bottleneck each other is crucial for optimizing performance in gaming and other computational tasks.</p>

        <h2>GPU Bottleneck</h2>
        <p>A GPU bottleneck occurs when the CPU is too powerful for the GPU, causing the GPU to be unable to keep up with the CPU's processing speed. This results in lower frame rates and underutilization of the GPU.</p>

        <h2>CPU Bottleneck</h2>
        <p>A CPU bottleneck happens when the GPU is too powerful for the CPU, leading to the CPU being unable to process data quickly enough for the GPU. This can cause stuttering, frame drops, and longer load times.</p>

        <h2>Balancing Performance</h2>
        <p>To avoid bottlenecks, it's important to balance the performance of your CPU and GPU. This ensures that neither component is significantly limiting the performance of the other.</p>
